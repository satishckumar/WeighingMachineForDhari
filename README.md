# WeighingMachineForDhari

The Basis of this weighing machine is the 50 KG load cell , connected into a Wheatstone Bridge. 
The output of the sensor is connected to HX 711, load cell amplifier. 
It is then interfaced with Arduino UNO as shown in the schematics. 
Arduino is then loaded  with suitable sketch for further signal  processing and calibration. 
The value ( Weight in KG) is then displayed on the  I2C OLED Display. 
The Schematics, Construction, Connector locations , Code..etc is loaded as a separate file .
